      Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was born December 10th, 1815, and died November 27th 1852. Augusta Byron was the only child of poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later. He died in Greece when Ada was 8 years old.<br> Ada's mother promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent Ada from developing insanity like her father had. In her childhood, Ada was often sick. In June 1829, she was paralyzed after contracting measles. She was on continuous bed rest for nearly a year. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she continued to develop her mathematical and technological skills.<br> In June 1833 during her teen years, Ada's mathematical talents led her to a friendship with British mathematician Charles Babbage, known as "the father of computers". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. She married William King in 1835. William King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.<br> When she died in 1852, due to uterine cancer and bloodletting, she was buried next to her father in Hucknall, Nottingham.

      Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, mainly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. According to some, she was the first to recognise the full potential of computers and was one of the first computer programmers.<br>Ada Byron translated an Italian mathematician’s memoir for Charles’ newest machine. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. In her notes, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason, unfortunately, it could never be tested as the analytical engine was never completed. <br> After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to her friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings like a calculus of the nervous system. She never achieved this, however.</p>
